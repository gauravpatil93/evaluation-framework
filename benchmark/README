Python dependencies:
argparse on python2 and python3 (available on pip)
trec_car_tools on python3 (https://github.com/TREMA-UNH/trec-car-tools/tree/v1.4)
itertools on python3 (available on pip)
pyLucene 6.4.1 on python2 (see detailed instructions below)


Instructions for downloading on debian distributions (tested on mint)

1. Download the pyLucene 6.4.1 installation archive on https://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/index.html. Extract the entire package somewhere (I just put it in my home directory, but this shouldn't matter). Change your directory to be inside pylucene-6.4.1

2. Install oracle-java-8 (9 might work as well):


(if the below doesn't work consult http://tipsonubuntu.com/2016/07/31/install-oracle-java-8-9-ubuntu-16-04-linux-mint-18/)
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install oracle-java8-installer
sudo apt install oracle-java8-set-default

If someone using java can see if you can revert your default to somewhere else and still have pylucene work that would be helpful.

3. Other python dependencies and c++ compiler (should be optional)
sudo apt install build-essential python-dev python-setuptools

4. Install ant

sudo-apt-get install ant

 

5. Prep jcc for installation

change directory to jcc directory (should just need to type cd jcc)

open the setup.py file in a text editor

change the jdk for linux2 to '/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle' (should be at line 57))

6. Build & Install jcc

python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

7. Prepare pylucene installation

cd ..

open the makefile in a text editor

Find out where the linux2 path definitions are (should be around line 70)
Uncomment them and change them to the following:

PREFIX_PYTHON=/usr
ANT=JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle /usr/bin/ant
PYTHON=$(PREFIX_PYTHON)/bin/python
JCC=$(PYTHON) -m jcc
NUM_FILES=8

8. Build, test install
make

make test

sudo make install
